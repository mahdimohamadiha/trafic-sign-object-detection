# What is YOLOv5?

On June 25th, 2020, the first official version of YOLOv5 was released by Ultralytics, a computer vision model used for detecting objects.
OLOv5 is a model in the You Only Look Once (YOLO) family of computer vision models. YOLOv5 comes in four main versions: small (s), medium (m), large (l), and extra large (x), each offering progressively higher accuracy rates. Each variant also takes a different amount of time to train.
